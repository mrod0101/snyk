# snyk test -- test an open source project for vulnerabilities

## Usage

`snyk test [<OPTIONS>]`

## Description

The test command checks locally installed or remote open source projects for vulnerabilities. It tries to autodetect supported manifest files with dependencies and test those. Example: `test https://github.com/snyk/snyk`

## Exit codes

Possible exit codes and their meaning:

**0**: success, no vulns found<br />
**1**: action_needed, vulns found<br />
**2**: failure, try to re-run command<br />
**3**: failure, no supported projects detected<br />

## Options

For command-specific information, use the `--help` option with any command, for example, `snyk container --help`. See also subsequent sections for options available across all commands; options for specific build environments, package managers, and languages; and `[<CONTEXT-SPECIFIC OPTIONS>]` which you specify last.

### `--all-projects`

Auto-detect all projects in the working directory.

### `--detection-depth=<DEPTH>`

Use with --all-projects or --yarn-workspaces to indicate how many sub-directories to search. `DEPTH` must be a number.

Default: 4 (the current working directory and 3 sub-directories).
Example: `--detection-depth=3` limits search to the specified directory (or the current directory if no `<PATH>` is specified) plus three levels of subdirectories.

### `--exclude=<DIRECTORY>[,<DIRECTORY>]...>`

Can be used with --all-projects and --yarn-workspaces to indicate sub-directories and files to exclude. Must be comma separated.

Use the exclude option with `--detection-depth` to ignore directories at any depth.

### `--prune-repeated-subdependencies`, `-p`

Prune dependency trees, removing duplicate sub-dependencies.
Continues to find all vulnerabilities, but potentially not all of the vulnerable paths.

### `--print-deps`

Print the dependency tree before sending it for analysis.

### `--remote-repo-url=<URL>`

Set or override the remote URL for the repository that you would like to monitor.

### `--dev`

Include development-only dependencies. Applicable only for some package managers, for example _devDependencies_ in npm or _:development_ dependencies in Gemfile.

Default: scan only production dependencies.

### `--org=<ORG_NAME>`

Specify the <ORG_NAME>, that is, the Organization ID from those in your Snyk account, to run Snyk commands tied to a specific organization. This influences where new projects are created after running the `monitor` command, some features availability, and private test limits.
If you have multiple organizations, you can set a default from the CLI using:

`$ snyk config set org=<ORG_NAME>`

Set a default to ensure all newly monitored projects are created
under your default organization. If you need to override the default, use the `--org=<ORG_NAME>` option.

Default: `<ORG_NAME>` that is the current preferred organization in your [Account settings](https://app.snyk.io/account).

### `--file=<FILE>`

Set a package file.

When testing locally or monitoring a project, you can specify the file that Snyk should inspect for package information. When omitted Snyk tries to detect the appropriate file for your project.

### `--ignore-policy`

Ignore all set policies, the current policy in the `.snyk` file, Org level ignores, and the project policy on snyk.io.

### `--trust-policies`

Apply and use ignore rules from the Snyk policies your dependencies; otherwise ignore rules in the dependencies are only shown as a suggestion.

### `--show-vulnerable-paths`=none|some|all

Display the dependency paths from the top level dependencies down to the vulnerable packages. Does not affect output when using JSON `--json` output.

Default: `<some>` (a few example paths shown).
`<false>` is an alias for `<none>`.

### `--project-name=<PROJECT_NAME>`

Specify a custom Snyk project name.

### `--target-reference=<TARGET_REFERENCE>`

Specify a reference which differentiates this project, for example, a branch name or version. Projects having the same reference can be grouped based on that reference. Only supported for Snyk Open Source. See [Separating projects by branch or version](https://snyk.info/3B0vTPs).

### `--policy-path=<PATH_TO_POLICY_FILE>`

Manually pass a path to a snyk policy file.

### `--json`

Print results in JSON format.

### `--json-file-output=<OUTPUT_FILE_PATH>`

Save test output in JSON format directly to the specified file, regardless of whether or not you use the `--json` option.
This is especially useful if you want to display the human-readable test output via stdout and at the same time save the JSON format output to a file.

### `--sarif`

Return results in SARIF format.

### `--sarif-file-output=<OUTPUT_FILE_PATH>`

Save test output in SARIF format directly to the <OUTPUT_FILE_PATH> file, regardless of whether or not you use the `--sarif` option.
This is especially useful if you want to display the human-readable test output via stdout and at the same time save the SARIF format output to a file.

### `--severity-threshold=low|medium|high|critical`

Report only vulnerabilities of specified level or higher.

### `--fail-on=all|upgradable|patchable`

Fail only when there are vulnerabilities that can be fixed.

- `all`: fails when there is at least one vulnerability that can be either upgraded or patched.
- `upgradable`: fails when there is at least one vulnerability that can be upgraded.
- `patchable`: fails when there is at least one vulnerability that can be patched.

If vulnerabilities do not have a fix and this option is being used, tests pass.

## Options available across all commands

#### `--insecure`

Ignore unknown certificate authorities.

#### `-d`

Output debug logs.

#### `--quiet`, `-q`

Silence all output.

#### `--version`, `-v`

Print versions.

#### `--help`, `-h`

Print help text. Note that help is also a command: `help [<COMMAND>]`.

## Options for Maven projects

[More information about Maven CLI options](https://snyk.co/ucT6P)

### `--scan-all-unmanaged`

Auto detect maven jars, aars, and wars in given directory. To test individually use `--file=<JAR_FILE_NAME>`.

### `--reachable`

Analyze your source code to find which vulnerable
functions and packages are called.

### `--reachable-timeout=<TIMEOUT>`

Specify the amount of time (in seconds) to wait for Snyk to gather reachability data. If it takes longer than `<TIMEOUT>`, reachable vulnerabilities are not reported. This does not affect regular test or monitor output.

Default: 300 (5 minutes).

## Options for Gradle projects

[More information about Gradle CLI options](https://snyk.co/ucT6P)

### `--sub-project=<NAME>`, `--gradle-sub-project=<NAME>`

For Gradle "multi project" configurations, test a specific sub-project.

### `--all-sub-projects`

For "multi project" configurations, test all sub-projects.

### `--configuration-matching=<CONFIGURATION_REGEX>`

Resolve dependencies using only configuration(s) that match the specified Java regular expression, for example, `^releaseRuntimeClasspath$`.

### `--configuration-attributes=<ATTRIBUTE>[,<ATTRIBUTE>]...`

Select certain values of configuration attributes to install dependencies and perform dependency resolution, for example, `buildtype:release,usage:java-runtime`.

### `--reachable`

Analyze your source code to find which vulnerable
functions and packages are called.

### `--reachable-timeout=<TIMEOUT>`

Specify the amount of time (in seconds) to wait for Snyk to gather reachability data. If it takes longer than `<TIMEOUT>`, reachable vulnerabilities are not reported. This does not affect regular test or monitor output.

Default: 300 (5 minutes).

### `--init-script=<FILE`

Use for projects that contain a gradle initialization script.

## Options for .Net and NuGet projects

### `--assets-project-name`

When monitoring a .NET project using NuGet `PackageReference` use the project name in project.assets.json, if found.

### `--packages-folder`

Specify a custom path to the packages folder.

### `--project-name-prefix=<PREFIX_STRING>`

When monitoring a .NET project, use this option to add a custom prefix to the name of files inside a project along with any desired separators, for example, `snyk monitor --file=my-project.sln --project-name-prefix=my-group/`. This is useful when you have multiple projects with the same name in other sln files.

## Options for npm projects

### `--strict-out-of-sync=true|false`

Control testing out of sync lockfiles.

Default: true

## Options for Yarn projects

### `--strict-out-of-sync=true|false`

Control testing out of sync lockfiles.

Default: true

### `--yarn-workspaces`

Detect and scan yarn workspaces. You can specify how many sub-directories to search using `--detection-depth` and exclude directories and files using `--exclude`.

## Options for CocoaPods projects

### `--strict-out-of-sync=true|false`

Control testing out of sync lockfiles.

Default: false

## Options for Python projects

### `--command=<COMMAND>`

Indicate which specific Python commands to use based on Python version. The default is `python` which executes your default python version. Run 'python -V' to find out what version it is. If you are using multiple Python versions, use this parameter to specify the correct Python command for execution.

Default: `python`
Example: `--command=python3`

### `--skip-unresolved`=true|false

Allow skipping packages that are not found in the environment.

## `-- [<CONTEXT-SPECIFIC_OPTIONS>]`

Use context-specific options to pass extra arguments directly to Gradle, Maven, or other build tools. These options are specified last. Example: `snyk test -- --build-cache`

## Environment variables

You can set these environment variables to change CLI settings.

### `SNYK_TOKEN`

Snyk authorization token. Setting this envvar overrides the token that may be available in your `snyk config` settings.

### `SNYK_CFG_KEY`

Allows you to override any key that is also available as a `snyk config` option.

For example, `SNYK_CFG_ORG=myorg` overrides the default org option in `config` with "myorg".

## Connecting to the Snyk API

By default the Snyk CLI connects to `https://snyk.io/api/v1`.

### `SNYK_API`

Sets the API host to use for Snyk requests. Useful for on-premise instances and configuring proxies. If set with the `http` protocol the CLI upgrades the requests to `https`, unless `SNYK_HTTP_PROTOCOL_UPGRADE` is set to `0`.

### `SNYK_HTTP_PROTOCOL_UPGRADE=0`

If set to the value of `0`, API requests aimed at `http` URLs are not upgraded to `https`. If not set, the default behavior is to upgrade these requests from `http` to `https`. Useful, for example, for reverse proxies.

### `HTTPS_PROXY` and `HTTP_PROXY`

Allows you to specify a proxy to use for `https` and `http` calls. The `https` in the `HTTPS_PROXY` means that _requests using `https` protocol_ use this proxy. The proxy itself doesn't need to use `https`.
